True or not, the democratic approach has been successful, and the nation is extremely productive. While the worship of Helial is widespread, even beyond the borders of Curland, its practice is not forced on citizens.",

He was frantically looking for help. Witnesses saw his sister be abducted and taken by horseback out of the city. He knew time was of the essence. The party offered to help.\n\nFaelyn was able to follow the trail for about a half hour's ride before it became too muddied by other traffic, but the wolf and Tora could tell by her scent that she was close. Tora and Faelyn's wolf split up and discovered two bandit camps. Given the two options, Longo confidently chose the one to the north.\n\nTora snuck to a point between the two camps. Haffa went to the south camp in an attempt to create a distraction and drive the bandits towards Tora. Castigus, Faelyn, and Longo went to the north camp with the same aim.\n\nFaelyn quietly approached the camp and saw a tall human mage crouched down next to the unconscious Hild, bound and wearing some sort of blindfold. He was waving some sort of amulet over her body. Faelyn took careful aim and shot an arrow at the arm holding the amulet. He struck true, but the arrow seemed to bounce off some invisible armour. Startled, the mage dropped the amulet and stood, looking around. At that same time, Haffa began his assault of the southern camp, creating an enormous ruckus. With a snap of his fingers, the caster created a portal behind him, through which he stepped and disappeared. Faelyn and her wolf dashed to Hild's side, terrifying the bandits who fled. But one found herself face to face with Tora, who pinned her to the ground. Castigus and Longo rushed into the camp, Longo going to his sister and Castigus taking and examining the amulet. What was happening here?"
